🖼️ Image Resizer using Python
📏 A Simple Python Project to Resize Images

📌 Introduction : 
The Image Resizer is a Python-based application that allows users to resize an image by specifying custom width and height. It uses the OpenCV (cv2) library to process and resize images efficiently.

🔧 Features
✅ Loads and resizes an image based on user-defined dimensions
✅ Ensures the image exists before processing
✅ Allows custom width and height input from the user
✅ Saves the resized image in the specified location

🚀 Usage : 
The program loads an image and verifies if it exists.
It asks the user to enter the new height and width for resizing.
The resized image is saved in the specified directory.

📌 Dependencies : 
Python 3.x
OpenCV (cv2)

🔑 How It Works : 
Load an image from the given path.
Ask for custom dimensions (height & width) from the user.
Resize the image using OpenCV’s cv2.resize() method.
Save the resized image to a specified path

📌 Example Output:
Enter new height: 400
Enter new width: 600
Resized image saved at: C:\Users\MANISH CHOUDHARY\Desktop\Python Projects\Image Resizer\newimage.jpg
